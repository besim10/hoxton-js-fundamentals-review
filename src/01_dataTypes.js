 * @description This is a test to see how well you understand data types in javascript.
 * Write your solutions right below the comments. Use any tools you need to check the answers
 *
 * Don't remove the comments, Ed needs to know what's going on.
 *
 * As tempting as it may be, don't look in the previous exercises for answers. I don't care if you can open them.
 * I care if you can do these yourself 😊
 *
 * If you get stuck on a task - that's good. It means that we're not wasting time here.
 * Note it and skip it. We will later cover it in a 1x1 session and make sure you udnerstand it :P

// 1. create a constant called 'pi' and assign it the value of 3.14
const pi = 3.14
// 2 create a variable called 'radius' and assign it the value of 10
let radius = 10
// 2.1 now, change its value to 20
radius = 20
// 3. create a variable called 'area' and calculate the area using your variables
//   The formula is: area = pi x radius-squared
const area = pi * (radius * radius) 
// 4. Create an array called 'garage' with these cars inside:
//   - volvo
//   - audi
//   - mercedes
//   - bmw
let garage = ['volvo', 'audi','mercedes', 'bmw']
// Now, without manually typing the array:
// 4.1 add 'ferrari' to the garage
// garage.push('ferrari')
garage = [...garage, 'ferrari']
// 4.2 remove Mercedes from the array
garage = garage.filter((car) => !car.includes('mercedes'))
// 4.3 replace the 2nd car in the array with 'lada'
garage[1] = 'lada'
// 4.4 create an array with all of the cars in the garage capitalized
let capitalizedArray = []
for(const car of garage){
    capitalizedArray.push(car.toUpperCase())
}
// 4.5 find the volvo. pretend you don't know what the array looks like.
let foundedCar = garage.find((car) => car.includes('volvo'))

// 5 Create an object called 'myself' with these properties and assign them your values.
// Use appropriate datatypes for the values:
//   - name
//   - age
//   - isHungry
//   - favouriteAnimal
const myself = {
    name: 'Besim',
    age: 26,
    isHungry: true,
    favoriteAnimal: 'Lion'
}
// 5.1 Replace the favouriteAnimal with 'turtle'
myself.favoriteAnimal = 'turtle'
// 5.2 add an address property, which tracks your city, country and street name
myself.address = {
    city: 'Rahovec',
    country: 'Kosovo',
    streetName: 'Bekim Bugari'
}

// 5.3 add a list of favouriteFoods to the object. Add your favourite foods to the list (duhhh!)
myself.favoriteFoods = ['Pizza', 'Hamburger', 'Sandwich']
// 5.3 remove the age property
delete myself.age

// 5.4 Have a snack. Set isHungry to false (even if you're not really hungry).
myself.isHungry = false
// 5.5 Add a function to the object called 'eat'. It should take a food as an argument and return "Name ate food!"
// That's a mouthful, so here's an example:
// e.g. calling the eat function with a banana argument, in an object where the name is 'Nico' should return "Nico ate banana!"
// e.g. calling the eat function with an apple argument, in an object where the name is 'Ilir' should return "Ilir ate apple!"

myself.eat = (food) => `${myself.name} ate ${food}` 

let result = myself.eat('Banana')
